# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Dataset Limitations
The performance and behavior of the current machine learning model are heavily influenced by the dataset used for training and testing. The following limitations were observed:

Dataset Quality: The dataset used in this project had significant limitations, including imbalances and potential biases. These issues have directly impacted the model's ability to generalize effectively.

Feature Importance: Due to the dataset's structure and characteristics, the model primarily relies on the amount feature for classification. This may not accurately represent real-world scenarios where fraudulent transactions depend on multiple complex factors.

Lack of Diverse Patterns: The dataset does not capture a wide range of behaviors or patterns associated with fraud, leading to oversimplified decision boundaries in the model.

Note: While the current model achieves predictions based on the given data, its real-world applicability may be limited without a more robust and comprehensive dataset. For better results, future iterations should focus on sourcing higher-quality data with richer features and better fraud representation.
